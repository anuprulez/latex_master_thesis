\chapter*{Acknowledgment}

I express my gratitude to all the people who helped me finishing this work. I thank Dr. Björn Grüning who entrusted me with the task of building a recommendation system for Galaxy. His pragmatic suggestions concerning the tools and workflows helped me to understand them better and improve the results. His advise to create a visualizer for showing the similar tools did wonders as it helped me find and rectify few bugs which would have been difficult to identify. Similar trick to create a visualizer for browsing the results worked with the next task of predicting future tools in workflows as well. I thank Eric Rasche who extracted the workflows for me from the Galaxy Freiburg server. I thank Dr. Mehmet Tekman and Joachim Wolff for their expert feedback and insights. In the end, I wish to thank all the other members of Freiburg Galaxy team for their continuous support and help.
