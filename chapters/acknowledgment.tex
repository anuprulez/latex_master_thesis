\chapter*{Acknowledgment}

I express my gratitude to all the people who encouraged and supported me to accomplish this work. I am grateful to my mentor Dr. Björn Grüning who entrusted me with the task of building a recommendation system for Galaxy. He facilitated this work by providing me with all the indispensable means. Being specific, his pragmatic suggestions concerning the Galaxy tools and workflows helped me discern them better and improve the performance. His advice to create a visualizer for showing the similar tools worked wonders as it enabled me to find and rectify a few bugs which were tough to establish. For the next task, creating a separate visualizer for looking through the next predicted tools was conducive in all merits. I appreciate and thank Eric Rasche who extracted the workflows for me from the Galaxy Freiburg server. I offer thanks to Dr. Mehmet Tekman and Joachim Wolff for their expert feedback, insights and general advice. At length, I wish to thank all the other members of Freiburg Galaxy team for their continuous support and help.
