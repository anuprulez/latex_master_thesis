\section{Get true value}
To quantify the improvements, we need to set absolute true values among tools. It means that we should create a dictionary of say $10$ similar tools for each tool. Using this constraint, we can verify our findings in a reliable way. Otherwise, we need to have a visualizer to look through the results to find whether we improve. On the other hand, it is not an easy task to create logical categories of thousands of tools.

\section{Correlation}
Our similarity matrices are dense. We can nullify some low scores to retain only higher similarity scores. We can do it by finding the median value of similarity scores for a tool and set the scores to 0 which are lower than median. After this, we can optimize the scores and see the distribution and results if we improve.
