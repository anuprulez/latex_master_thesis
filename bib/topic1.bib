pages="789--794",
abstract="A new class of tests for testing the homogeneity of two independent polynomial samples is proposed. Our tests are a natural extension of those based on Jaccard's index of similarity. The theory of separable statistics is applied. We investigate asymptotic powers of these tests. The results of numerical analysis allow us to select the asymptotically optimal test of similarity within this class.",
